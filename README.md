# -PREDICTIVE-ANALYSIS-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
This project uses machine learning models to predict future outcomes based on historical data. It involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training (classification or regression), and performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy or RÂ² score. The final model helps in making data-driven decisions effectively.
